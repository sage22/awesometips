When you are experiencing an issue where you can open/execute a program
under a certain user but not a different user and you fault out with
a gtk display error message or no display etc.

First check environment variables for display $DISPLAY=0:0
Make sure environment variables are set the same for the user
that it is working. If all else fails an you rule out all other issues,
run 
$ xhost +

This command grants permissions for all users to access xserver to utilize 
xhost display to open program.
